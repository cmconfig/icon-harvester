## Introduction

Microsoft Configuration Manager allows IT administrators to effectively manage both PCs and servers by ensuring software remains up to date, enforcing configuration and security policies, and maintaining system health—all while enabling users to access corporate applications from their preferred devices. When combined with Microsoft Intune, Configuration Manager delivers unified management for on-premises PCs and Macs, as well as cloud-connected mobile devices running Windows, iOS, and Android — all through a single, centralized console.

Recent updates to Configuration Manager — including capabilities such as Windows 10 in-place upgrades, co-management with Microsoft Intune, the Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise Servicing Dashboard, and integration with Windows Update for Business — make deploying and managing Windows environments simpler and more efficient than ever before.

IT professionals can now automate software rollouts, enforce compliance configurations, and track endpoint health with enhanced precision and control. The advanced reporting and analytics tools deliver deeper insights into device performance and update progress, empowering organizations to make data-driven decisions and swiftly address emerging issues.

Configuration Manager’s tight integration with cloud services through Microsoft Intune also supports hybrid management scenarios, enabling enterprises to manage users and devices consistently, no matter where they are or how they connect. This unified management model reduces complexity, strengthens security, and ensures all devices — both local and remote — comply with organizational policies.
